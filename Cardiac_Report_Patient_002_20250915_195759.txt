CLINICAL REPORT

PATIENT INFORMATION:
Patient ID: Patient_002
Age: 40 years
Gender: Male

MODALITY:
CT

CONDITION DIAGNOSED:
Coronary Artery Disease

ICD-10 CODE:
I25

FINDINGS:
Findings are suggestive of coronary artery disease.
Possible calcifications or narrowing were observed within the coronary arteries.

The cardiac area was measured at 0.974, indicating a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Image contrast was noted at 0.219, which is elevated and may be indicative of calcifications within the coronary vessels.
CT imaging provided excellent visualization of these potential coronary calcifications.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Further evaluation with coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is strongly recommended to further characterize the extent and severity of coronary artery disease and to assess for significant stenoses.

Cardiology consultation is advised for comprehensive clinical assessment and management planning.

Assessment of lipid profile and other cardiac risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, family history) is recommended to guide preventive strategies.

CARDIAC MRI REPORT

Patient ID: Patient_002
Age: 40
Gender: M
Date of Report: 2023-10-27

Modality: Cardiac MRI

Clinical Indication: Evaluation for suspected coronary artery disease.

Condition Diagnosed: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
ICD-10 Code: I25

FINDINGS:

Cardiac MRI demonstrates findings suggestive of underlying coronary artery disease.

Possible calcifications or narrowing were observed within the coronary arteries during the assessment.

The calculated cardiac area measures 0.974, which is considered slightly enlarged for the patient's demographics.

Image contrast was measured at 0.218, which is elevated and may further support the presence of calcifications within the vascular structures.

This MRI study provided detailed tissue characterization and functional assessment of the myocardium and associated structures.

IMPRESSION:

Findings are indicative of coronary artery disease with evidence of possible vascular calcifications and slight cardiac enlargement.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Further evaluation with coronary CT angiography is strongly recommended to more precisely delineate coronary anatomy and assess the extent of stenosis and calcification.

Cardiology consultation is advised for comprehensive clinical correlation and management planning.

Lipid profile and a thorough cardiac risk factor assessment should be performed.
